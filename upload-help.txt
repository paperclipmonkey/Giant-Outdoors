Add details
Inside the web folder there is a folder called /upload/.
This stores all of the uploaded files from the website. Uploaded files are there right next to JSON files.
http://www.wikiwand.com/en/JSON
The JSON files are named by the time and date the user uploaded them. These files are just basic key->value records for each of the form elements on the page.
By opening these files in any coding text editor (Sublime Text, Dreamweaver, NotePad++, TextEdit) it will be possible to copy the values out.

To add these uploads to the website open the assets/geojson/ folder. Inside here is all of the data for the website.
The data is categorised in to files, one for each marker type. Open up added.geojson.
The format is the same as for the upload folder, with an array [] of objects {}, each being a point on the map.
Start by copying one of these object and placing it below the others.
aka:
	,
	{  
      "type":"Feature",
      "properties":{  
        "Title":"Common blue butterfly",
        "StartDate":"",
        "EndDate":"",
        "Sketchfab":"",
        "Image":"",
        "Description":"Living up to its name, this is the commonest blue butterfly found in Britain. We recorded a sighting in the quoit field, known as the Frying Pan field, in 2014 during a quoit workshop.",
        "URL":"",
        "Walk 1":"1",
        "Walk 2":"1",
        "Walk 3":"1",
        "Walk 4":"1",
        "Tags":[  
          "add",
          "butterfly",
          "workshop"
        ],
        "Marker Type":"added",
        "Hashcode":"common_blue_butterfly"
      },
      "geometry":{  
        "type":"Point",
        "coordinates":[  
          -5.293455,
          50.18883
        ]
      }
    }

You can then edit this data, replacing the fields you need to.
Save the file and try to run the site locally. It should work, apart from the video file which requires a web server to run.
Once you're happy with the new data replace the file on the webserver with your updated file.


potential issues:
It's important to remember that between any two objects there needs to be a comma. If the entire file doesn't load this is most likely the problem.

Also, all text has to be inside double quotes, these can't be sided - no fancy quotes. Numbers should be outside of quotes: eg the coordinates.
By saving a backup of the file before you start editing any problems you encounter can be easily rolled back.
