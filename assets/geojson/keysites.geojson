The tomb  beneath the cromlech does not seem to have been excavated, perhaps due to the state of the capstone, which  weighs 10 tons. A long narrow pit sunk by the cromlech was discovered in the early hours of the morning. It was supposed that someone had a dream or vision of buried treasure. Reference: Johnny Arthur (1860-1940)",
