        "Description":"Carwynnen Quoit, the Giant's Quoit, is a Neolithic cromlech, a stone monument with a chambered tomb beneath. It was first recorded in 1700 and marked as 'cromlech' on the 1839 OS map. The quoit first collapsed around 1842, was subsequently re-erected, and we know that in 1950 the monument consisted of three uprights supporting a capstone. It collapsed again in 1966 and was re-erected by Sustrust in summer, 2014.",

The tomb  beneath the cromlech does not seem to have been excavated, perhaps due to the dangerous state of the capstone, which must weigh at least 10 tons. Mr Tripp, a farmhand, discovered a long narrow pit sunk by the cromlech in the early hours of the morning. It was supposed that someone had a dream or vision of buried treasure.
