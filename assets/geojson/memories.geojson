        "Description":"Donald Thomas was born in Troon in 1936, where he grew up and was involved in village life. Sadly he passed away in 2014, not long after we recorded him for this project. He was the first person we talked to who remembered the Gorsedh at the quoit in 1948, and he shares his memories in the video. He also talks of his favourite walk, to Copper Hill, and the wonderful view. The walk takes you south east of the quoit.",
