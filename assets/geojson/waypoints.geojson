At the side of the stream (which rises on Chycame Moor and flows through Troon, the Reens, and feeds Pendarves lake) is Reens Rock. Also known as Carrek Veryasek, the granite outcrop is said to have provided shelter for St Meriasek. The remains of St Ia's Chapel (probably 10th and 12th century), built next to the holy well, were excavated in 1962. These are on the opposite side of the stream from Reens Rock, on an ancient trackway leading to Camborne and beyond.",
