<h2>About the key features of the app</h2>
<h3>EXPLORE Tab</h3>
<p>
This displays the routes of four short walks around the landscape.<br/>
Click on the coloured markers to learn about:<br/>
1. Archaeological finds (brown).<br/>
2. Settlements (orange).<br/>
3. Plants (green).<br/>
4. Real people’s memories of the area.<br/>
Click on the walk tracks and download them to your GPS unit or smart phone if you have one. Download PDFs if you want to print out the maps on paper.<br/>
Yellow circles are used to show when markers are off the screen.

<h3>VIEWING Tab (at right of screen)</h3>
<p>
As with online maps, you can choose either an up-to-date map display or a satellite image. And using a slider you can also go back in time and see an old Ordnance Survey (OS) map from 1906. You might want to compare the earlier landscape with the present day, to see what has changed over time. <br/> 
A second slider adds another level, displaying the geology of the area, which shows the quoit lying at the edge of a granite outcrop. Archaeologists think this is one of the reasons why the quoit was built in this location. <br/>
A third slider takes you to the overall excavation plan of the footprint of the quoit. You need to zoom into to the quoit to see it – a key explains the different elements that were found such as the quoit’s socket holes, its Neolithic pavement and some bone sample.

<h3>DIG Tab</h3>
<p>
At this level, you can go back in time and discover what the archaeologists found in the quoit field.<br/>
Choose brown markers to bring up a photograph of a find and sometimes a 3D model. Use your cursor to turn the model around and look at it in detail.<br/>
Click on an orange marker to learn about other sites or objects found in the same period.<br/>
The timeline at the bottom of the window is divided into different historical periods. Slide the bar along and the finds that were discovered in that period will be displayed.
</p>
 
<h3>ADD Tab</h3>
<p>
This gives you the opportunity to upload your own photographs and impressions.<br/>
You might want to tell others what you enjoyed or share a discovery you made. Once you have uploaded images or text (or both), they will appear on the map as a blue marker. Help us to build up a picture of the area by adding your contributions and see what other people have added.
