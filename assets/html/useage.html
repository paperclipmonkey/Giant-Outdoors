<h2>About the key features of the app</h2>
<h3>EXPLORE Tab</h3>
<p>
This displays the routes of four short walks around the landscape.<br/>
Click on the coloured markers to learn about:<br/>
1. Settlements (orange).<br/>
2. Archaeological finds (brown).<br/>
3. Real people’s memories of the area (purple).<br/>
4. Plants (green).<br/>
5. Information about how to find your way on the landscape if you are on foot (pink).<br/>
6. Text or images or both that the general public have added about the landscape (blue).
</p>
<p>
Click on the walk tracks and download them to your GPS unit or smart phone if you have one. Download PDFs if you want to print out the maps on paper.
</p>
<p>
Yellow circles are used to show when markers are off the screen.
</p>
<h3>VIEWING Tab (at right of screen)</h3>
<p>
As with online maps, you can choose either an up-to-date map display or a satellite image. And using a slider you can also go back in time and see an old Ordnance Survey (OS) map from 1906. You might want to compare the earlier landscape with the present day, to see what has changed over time.
</p>
<p>
<span class="description">A second slider</span> takes you to the overall excavation plan of the footprint of the quoit. You need to zoom into to the quoit to see it – a key explains the different elements that were found such as the quoit’s socket holes, its Neolithic pavement and some bone sample.</p>
<p>
<span class="description">A third slider</span> adds another level, displaying the geology of the area, which shows the quoit lying at the edge of a granite outcrop. Archaeologists think this is one of the reasons why the quoit was built in this location.
</p>
<p>
<span class="description">A fourth slider</span> creates orange shaded areas on the map that are called viewsheds.  These 'views' tell us what you can see from the quoit. These help us to see what neolithic people would have seen from the quoit, and explain that the quoit sits in secluded part of the landscape. 
</p> 
 
<h3>DIG Tab</h3>
<p>
At this level, you can go back in time and discover what the archaeologists found in the quoit field.
</p>
<p>
<span class="description">Choose brown markers</span> to bring up a photograph of a find and sometimes a 3D model. Use your cursor to turn the model around and look at it in detail.
</p>
<p>
<span class="description">Click on an orange marker</span> to learn about other sites or objects found in the same period.
</p>
<p>
<span class="description">The timeline at the bottom</span> of the window is divided into different historical periods. Slide the bar along and the finds that were discovered in that period will be displayed.
</p>
 
<h3>ADD Tab</h3>
<p>
This gives you the opportunity to upload your own photographs and impressions.<br/>
You might want to tell others what you enjoyed or share a discovery you made. Once you have uploaded images or text (or both), they will appear on the map as a blue marker. Help us to build up a picture of the area by adding your contributions and see what other people have added.
