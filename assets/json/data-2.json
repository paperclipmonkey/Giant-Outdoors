In 1950 the monument consisted of three uprights supporting a capstone, having been re-erected after the collapse of the chamber just before 1872. The chamber collapsed again in 1966. In 2014 it was re-erected.",

There are many factors, which could have caused the markings, and they may not have been part of a single considered act.

Condurrow improved drastically in the 1820s (1,200 tons of copper ore produced in 1826), but closed by 1830. The mine reopened in 1844, with copper ore output rising dramatically from 50 tons that year to 1,550 tons in 1848, and stayed at around 1,750 tons annually until collapsing in 1863. Tin was first raised in 1851 but tonnages were small before the 1860s. After a long history under different companies in 1910 this mine became Cundurrow Mines Ltd., but was unsuccessful closing in 1914",
